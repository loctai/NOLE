                <h4>Terms &amp; Conditions</h4>
                <p>Such a sphere as international investment is always concerned with various risks. In most cases, investment platforms are not responsible for the client's actions. However, Nole company developed a multi-level insurance system under which 7% of all the deposited funds are transferred to several insurance companies. This sum automatically subtracted from our income and is sent to our investor's account avoiding negative risk's effects and unexpected money loss. Moreover, the only type of risk which worth taking into account is a force majeure. These are occasions which aren't dependant from the services provider such as natural disasters. Users involved in breaching the company rules or harmful actions will be banned without any notification. Moreover, the deposited funds may not be returned. If there is some damage caused by unsanctioned actions, the deposited money will be taken as compensation. Account block is quite a rare and radical action and Nole administration always tries to solve all the issues without penalties and account banning.</p>
